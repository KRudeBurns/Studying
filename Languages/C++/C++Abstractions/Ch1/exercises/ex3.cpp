/*
As mathematical historians have told the story, the German mathematician Carl
Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) began to show his mathematical talent at a very
early age. When he was in elementary school, Gauss was asked by his teacher
to compute the sum of the numbers between 1 and 100. Gauss is said to have
given the answer instantly: 5050. Write a program that computes the answer to
the question Gaussâ€™s teacher posed.
