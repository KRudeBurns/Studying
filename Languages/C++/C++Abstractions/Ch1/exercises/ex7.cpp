/*
Using the AddIntegerList program from Figure 1-5 as a model, 
write a program AverageList that reads in a list of integers 
representing exam scores and then prints out the average. 

Because some unprepared student might actually get a score of 0, 
your program should use âˆ’1 as the sentinel to mark the end of the input.
