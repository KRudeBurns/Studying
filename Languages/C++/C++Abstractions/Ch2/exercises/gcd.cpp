/* 
Euclid outlines a procedure for finding the greatest common divisor (or gcd for short)
of two integers x and y,which is defined to be the largest integer that divides 
evenly into both.  For example, the gcd of 49 and 35 is 7, the gcd of 6 and 18 is 6, 
and the gcd of 32 and 33 is 1

In modern English, Euclidâ€™s algorithm can be described as follows:
   1. Divide x by y and compute the r; call that r r.
   2. If r is zero, the algorithm is complete, and the answer is y.
   3. If r is not zero, set x to the old value of y, set y equal to r, and repeat the process.
