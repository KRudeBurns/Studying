/*
(Program) a. A professor has constructed a 3-by-5 two-dimensional array of grades.
This array contains the test grades of students in the professorâ€™s advanced compiler
design class. 

Write, compile, and run a C++ program that reads 15 array values and then determines 
the total number of grades in these ranges: less than 60, greater than or equal to 60 
and less than 70, greater than or equal to 70 and less than 80, greater than or equal 
to 80 and less than 90, and greater than or equal to 90.
