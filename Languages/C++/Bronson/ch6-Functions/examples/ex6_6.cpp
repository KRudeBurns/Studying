Topic: Inline Functions
Used for functions that are small and called infrequently.
The compiler will place the fuction code at the point where it is called
in the program.

/*
Each time an inline function is referenced, the complete function code is 
reproduced and stored as an integral part of the program.
A non-inline function, however, is stored in memory only once. 
No matter how many times the function is called, the same code is used.
Therefore, inline functions should be used only for small functions
that arenâ€™t called extensively in a program.
