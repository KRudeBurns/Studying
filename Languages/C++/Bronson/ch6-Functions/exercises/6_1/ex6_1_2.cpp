//2. (Practice) Write function headers for the following functions:


/*
a. A function named check(), which has three parameters.
The first parameter should accept an integer number, 
the second parameter a floating-point number, and the third parameter
a double-precision number. The function returns no value.
*/

void check(int, float, double)

/*
b. A function named findAbs() that accepts a double-precision number 
passed to it and returns that numberâ€™s absolute value.
*/
double findAbs(double)


/* c. A function named mult() that accepts two floating-point numbers as parameters, multiplies these two numbers, and returns the result. */
float mult(float, float)

/* d. A function named square() that computes and returns the square of the integer value passed to it. */
int square (int)

/* e. A function named powfun() that raises an integer number passed to it to a positive integer power (also passed as an argument) and returns the result as an integer. */

int powfun (int x, int power)


/* f. A function named table() that produces a table of numbers from 1 to 10, their squares, and their cubes. No arguments are to be passed to the function, and the function returns no value. */

void table()
